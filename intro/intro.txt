Hello, welcome to my voice-driven digital human full-body motion model test. Thank you very much for participating! In this test, you will see 10 sets of video files, each of which consists of three videos, one is the ground truth video, and the other is two AI-generated videos. You need to watch and compare the two AI-generated videos with the ground truth video. Each video is about 30 seconds long, and it may take 20 minutes to complete the entire test. We will collect your feedback on watching the video. I hope you can be fair and objective when making judgments. Thank you again for your participation!
